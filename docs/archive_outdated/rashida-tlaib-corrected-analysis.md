## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Previous Error:**
```sql
-- WRONG: No file_year filter
SELECT SUM(ic.transaction_amt) 
FROM individual_contributions ic
JOIN candidate_committee_linkages ccl ON ic.cmte_id = ccl.cmte_id
WHERE ccl.cand_id = 'H8MI13250' 
AND ccl.cand_election_yr = 2024  -- Only filtered by election year
AND ic.transaction_amt > 0
```

### **Corrected Query:**
```sql
-- CORRECT: Added file_year filter
SELECT SUM(ic.transaction_amt) 
FROM individual_contributions ic
JOIN candidate_committee_linkages ccl ON ic.cmte_id = ccl.cmte_id
WHERE ccl.cand_id = 'H8MI13250' 
AND ccl.cand_election_yr = 2024
AND ic.file_year = 2024  -- Added this filter
AND ic.transaction_amt > 0
```

## 🔧 **Required Fixes**

### **1. Update Database Functions**
```typescript
// In getCampaignFinanceTotals function
const totalsQuery = `
  SELECT 
    SUM(ic.transaction_amt) as total_receipts,
    COUNT(*) as contribution_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ic.name || ic.city || ic.state) as unique_contributors
  FROM individual_contributions ic
  JOIN candidate_committee_linkages ccl ON ic.cmte_id = ccl.cmte_id
  WHERE ccl.cand_id = $1 
  AND ccl.cand_election_yr = $2
  AND ic.file_year = $2  -- ADD THIS FILTER
  AND ic.transaction_amt > 0
`;
```

### **2. Update Top Contributors Function**
```typescript
// In getTopContributors function
const contributionsQuery = `
  SELECT 
    ic.name as contributor_name,
    ic.city as contributor_city,
    ic.state as contributor_state,
    SUM(ic.transaction_amt) as contribution_amount,
    COUNT(*) as contribution_count
  FROM individual_contributions ic
  JOIN candidate_committee_linkages ccl ON ic.cmte_id = ccl.cmte_id
  WHERE ccl.cand_id = $1 
  AND ccl.cand_election_yr = $2
  AND ic.file_year = $2  -- ADD THIS FILTER
  AND ic.transaction_amt > 0
  GROUP BY ic.name, ic.city, ic.state
  ORDER BY contribution_amount DESC
  LIMIT 20
`;
