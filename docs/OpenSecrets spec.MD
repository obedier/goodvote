OpenSecrets.org Front-End Functionality Specification
Overview and Site Structure
OpenSecrets.org is a comprehensive public portal for tracking money in U.S. politics. The site’s front-end presents a wide array of interactive tools, data visualizations, and searchable databases that allow users to explore political finance data. The navigation is organized into five primary sections – Politicians, Elections, Lobbying & Groups, Learn, and About – accessible via a top menu bar on every pageopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. Each section contains drop-down menus (mega-menus) revealing subsections and tools. The site emphasizes intuitive UI/UX with clear menus, filters, charts, and search capabilities for easy exploration.
Header Navigation: The persistent header menu provides one-click access to main categories. Hovering or clicking a category (on desktop) expands a menu of sub-pages and tools:
* Politicians: Data on federal and state officeholders, committees, and personal finances.
* Elections: Campaign finance data by race type (presidential, congressional, ballot measures, etc.), plus special tools like “Get Local!” and ad databases.
* Lobbying & Groups: Information on lobbying expenditures, industry influence, PACs, revolving door profiles, and organization contributions.
* Learn: Access to OpenSecrets news articles, reports, issue briefs, and educational resources on money in politics.
* About: Organizational information (mission, team, supporters) and ways to support or partner with OpenSecrets.
The header also features quick links (e.g. Buy Custom Data, Donate) and a search icon that opens a site-wide search interfaceopensecrets.org. On mobile devices, the menu collapses into a hamburger menu; subsections include a “Back” button for navigation as indicated by the presence of “Back” links in the HTML structureopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org.
Footer: A persistent footer is present on all pages, containing contact information, newsletter signup, social media links, and legal notices. It provides links to Contact, Donate, Buy Custom Data, and policiesopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. The footer also acknowledges that most site content is available under a Creative Commons license, with exceptions (e.g. Revolving Door data)opensecrets.org.
Breadcrumbs: Many pages include breadcrumb navigation near the top, showing the path (e.g. Home > Candidates & Officeholders > Congress) to aid orientationopensecrets.org. This helps users understand where they are in the site’s hierarchy and quickly jump to parent sections.
Global Search and Autocomplete
A prominent “Search OpenSecrets.org” feature allows users to query the site’s vast data. Clicking the search icon expands an overlay with a search bar and filter options. Users can filter the context of the search to specific categories: Site search (all content), Politicians & lobbyists, Organizations, Donors, Newsopensecrets.org. This enables targeted searches (e.g. limiting results to donor records or news articles). An autocomplete/suggestion system aids discovery: once the search interface is open, it displays “Popular Searches” lists. For example, it shows Top name searches (e.g. “jeffrey epstein”, “donald trump”), Top employer searches (e.g. “microsoft”, “planned parenthood”), and Top recipient searches(e.g. “trump”, “schumer”) as clickable suggestionsopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. These suggestions indicate frequently searched donors, employers, and recipients and update dynamically. The search overlay also lets users toggle the category filter before executing the query and provides an “Exit search” button to close the interfaceopensecrets.org.
When a search is executed, results are shown with relevant filters. The search functionality covers multiple data types, reflecting the site’s integrated data architecture (politician profiles, donor records, organizations, etc.). The interface prioritizes usability by encouraging specific queries (the site notes the database contains millions of records and suggests being specific for faster resultsopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org).
Politicians Section (Candidates & Officeholders)
This section focuses on individual politicians and officeholders, with separate pages and tools for federal officials and state officials.
* Members of Congress: A database of current and historical U.S. Congress members. The main Congress page lists current members of the 118th Congress with financial summariesopensecrets.org and provides filters and sorting. Users can filter by Party (All, Democrat, Independent, Republican, Third Party) and Chamber (All, House, Senate) via interactive controlsopensecrets.org. A dropdown allows switching between Congress sessions (e.g. 118th, 117th, etc.) which updates the data accordinglyopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. The table displays each member’s name (clickable to their profile), state, chamber, party, and campaign finance totals (amount raised, spent, cash on hand, debts) for the selected cycleopensecrets.org. Users can sort the table by clicking column headers (supporting multi-column sorting with shift-click)opensecrets.org. A “Reset Filters” link clears any party/chamber filtersopensecrets.org. For example, the list for the 118th Congress 2024 cycle is presented by default, showing entries like Alma Adams (North Carolina, House, Democrat) – $714,938 raisedopensecrets.org, etc. The interface also highlights congressional leadership: the Congress page features sections for House and Senate leaders (e.g. Speaker, Majority/Minority Leader) with headshots and links to their profilesopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org.
    * Politician Profile Pages: Clicking a name opens a detailed profile page for that member of Congress (or other politician). For example, Rep. Alma Adams’ profile shows a summary of her campaign financesopensecrets.org, top contributors and industries, and breakdowns of fundraising sources. Each profile has a header with the official’s name, office, and party/state identification (e.g. “Alma Adams – Representative (D-NC)”opensecrets.orgopensecrets.org). Profile pages are organized into tabbed sub-sections (displayed as a secondary menu). For federal lawmakers, these tabs include Summary, Elections, State Data, Industries, PACs, Contributors, Geography, Demographics, Expenditures, Legislation, and Other Dataopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. Users can toggle between these to view different aspects of the politician’s financial profile. The profile also allows selecting the election cycle (e.g. 2024, 2022, 2020, …, or “Career” aggregate) and the profile type (campaign committee only, leadership PAC only, or combined) via dropdowns or buttonsopensecrets.org. This updates the data displayed on the page.
        * Summary Tab: Presents key fundraising figures and at-a-glance stats for the selected cycle. It includes the total raised, spent, cash on hand, and debts for the campaign committee (and leadership PAC, if combined view)opensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. It also highlights the official’s Top Industry and Top Contributor for the cycle (with names and dollar amounts)opensecrets.org. These are displayed as quick facts (e.g. “Top Industry 2023–2024: Commercial Banks – $48,245”opensecrets.org). The summary further provides quick links to deeper data sections (e.g. Campaign Committee Fundraising, Top Contributors, Top Industries, Total Raised vs. Average, Source of Funds)opensecrets.org – often these are anchors to charts or tables further down the page.
        * The profile pages embed interactive charts and tables. For example, under “Source of Funds,” a pie chart or bar chart breaks down the percentage of contributions from PACs vs. large vs. small individual donors, etc., accompanied by a table of exact amountsopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. There is also a chart comparing the candidate’s fundraising to the average for their peers (“Total Raised vs. Average Raised”)opensecrets.org. These visualizations are interactive or static images with descriptive labels on the page.
        * Top Contributors & Industries: The summary section typically shows tables for Top Contributors and Top Industries for the candidate. In Alma Adams’ profile, for instance, the Top Contributors 2023–2024 table lists organizations and totals, split by contribution type (individual vs. PAC)opensecrets.org. The Top Industries 2023–2024 table lists industry categories with totals from individuals and PACsopensecrets.org. These tables give a quick insight into who is financially supporting the politician. Each category or contributor name may be clickable for further details (e.g. clicking an organization might go to an organization profile page).
        * Historical & Contextual Data: Profiles note the official’s first year in office and next electionyearopensecrets.org. They often include context-specific notes and disclaimers. For example, a help note explains why summary numbers may not match the sum of detailed records due to data release timing differencesopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. Another disclaimer clarifies that “organizations themselves did not donate; rather money came from the organizations’ PACs, employees, and their families” and that totals include affiliatesopensecrets.org – ensuring users interpret the data correctly.
        * Legislation Tab: Some profiles have a Legislation tab which may list the person’s sponsored bills and tie contributions to legislative action (or link to related data), and Other Data tab for any additional info (such as political career summary or expenditures breakdown by category). These sections add qualitative context but are largely static text or links, rather than data tables.
        * State-Level Data: For federal politicians, the State Data tab integrates state campaign finance data (if the politician held state-level offices or to show state-level contributions). OpenSecrets is in the process of integrating state data, and currently the site may link to an external legacy resource for state contributionsopensecrets.org.
        * Personal Finances: If the politician is a current/former federal official, their profile may link to personal financial disclosure summaries (though detailed personal finance data is primarily in the Personal Finances section of the site, described below).
* Presidential Administrations: This subsection (under Politicians > Federal) provides profiles for executive branch officials (e.g. cabinet members). It allows exploration of data connected to appointees, likely including campaign contributions, lobbying ties, or personal finances of notable officialsopensecrets.org. For example, the site features “Trump Administration Profile” pages for individuals, as referenced in OpenSecrets news (e.g. Mike Huckabee, Lee Zeldin profiles)opensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. These pages typically compile the official’s career donations and financial information. Users can navigate by administration (e.g. first Trump Administration) and person.
* Congressional Committees: Under Politicians > Federal, OpenSecrets offers a unique view of how money intersects with legislative committees. The Congressional Committees page allows users to select a specific committee and see funding profiles for its members. The interface presents two dropdowns: one to choose the Congress session (e.g. 118th, 117th, etc.) and another to select a House or Senate committeeopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. Users pick a chamber’s committee from extensive lists (covering all standing committees in House and Senate). Once a committee is selected, a profile page loads with multiple tabs:
    * Overview: An overview of the committee’s role and a narrative of how its work attracts donations. For example, the House Appropriations Committee overview explains that since the committee funds federal agencies, its members “attract donations from a wide spectrum of interests” such as defense, oil & gas, health servicesopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. This page also shows leadership (Chair and Ranking Member) for that Congressopensecrets.org.
    * The overview includes charts or tables of contributions by economic sector to all committee members. E.g., for House Appropriations (115th Congress), a table titled “Sectors Contributing to Members of this Committee, 2018 Election Cycle” lists sectors (Agribusiness, Defense, Finance, etc.) with totals from PACs vs. individualsopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. Each sector entry shows two numbers (from PACs and from individuals) for that cycle. These figures update when a different cycle is selected via a “Select cycle” toggle (e.g. 2016 vs 2018) and a “Change Congress number” dropdown at the bottom of the profileopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. The interface thus supports historical comparisons for committee funding.
    * Members: A roster of all committee members for that Congress, often with their party designation and possibly their contribution totals or ranks. This might be presented as a table or list (e.g. showing each member’s total fundraising from industries relevant to the committee).
    * Top Contributors: Aggregated top donor organizations across all committee membersopensecrets.org. For instance, the Top Contributors tab for the House Appropriations Committee (118th Congress, 2024 cycle) lists donors like American Israel Public Affairs Committee ($6.45M), National Assn of Realtors ($1.24M), etc., with breakdowns of money from individuals vs. PACsopensecrets.org. This reveals which interest groups, PACs or companies are most influential via donations to the committee’s legislators.
    * Top Industries: Similar to the above, but aggregating by industry. It shows which industries (e.g. Defense, Real Estate, Health) contributed the most to the committee members in the selected cycle.
    * Jurisdiction: A descriptive tab outlining the policy jurisdiction of the committee (what issues or agencies it oversees)opensecrets.org. This helps users understand why certain industries might lobby or donate to that committee.
    * Subcommittees: Lists the committee’s subcommittees and possibly links to their rosters or funding data. For example, Appropriations will list subcommittees like Defense, Agriculture, etc., though these subcommittee pages may have limited data on OpenSecrets.
* The Select/Special/Joint Committees page (accessible via a link in the committees interface) lists non-standing committeesopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. It enumerates special panels like the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the joint committees (Library, Printing, Taxation, etc.), and explains that some (like House Ethics) do not have fundraising profiles because they don’t oversee external interestsopensecrets.org.
* State Officials (Governors, Legislatures, etc.): Under Politicians > State, OpenSecrets provides profiles for state-level officeholders:
    * Governors: A tool to search donors to state governors and see which industries and groups support those state executivesopensecrets.org. Likely, a user can select a state governor to view their top contributors and industries (data sourced from state campaign finance disclosures). This section allows state-by-state browsing.
    * State Legislatures: An interface to follow the money for state legislative races in all 50 statesopensecrets.org. It may link to an external database or legacy site (OpenSecrets has partnered with the National Institute on Money in Politics for state data). Indeed, the site’s State Data is noted as coming from a “legacy” resource soon to be integratedopensecrets.org, indicating state contributions data is drawn from FollowTheMoney.orgopensecrets.org.
    * Judicial Officeholders: Profiles for elected judges in the 38 states that hold judicial electionsopensecrets.org, showing industries and donors supporting judicial campaigns.
    * Other Statewide Officeholders: Covers state-level offices like Attorneys General, Secretaries of State, etc., with similar donor profilesopensecrets.org.
* These state-level tools function similarly to federal ones: users select a state and then an official or office to see donation data. For example, a state legislature tool might allow choosing a state to get a summary of partisan fundraising or top contributors in that state’s legislative races. Because state data is extensive, OpenSecrets currently directs users to the “Get Local!” tool and legacy state data site for detailsopensecrets.org.
* Personal Finances (Personal Financial Disclosures): OpenSecrets offers a dedicated section for the personal finances of officials, accessible under Politicians > Federal. The Personal Finances page is a searchable database of federal officials’ financial disclosure reports and an analysis of their wealth. This section is formatted like a mini-site within OpenSecrets with multiple sub-pages and data viewsopensecrets.org. Key features include:
    * A summary explaining that while lawmakers have diverse investments like ordinary Americans, they generally have more wealth and must disclose investments, creating a unique datasetopensecrets.org.
    * Search functionality: input fields labeled Person, Company, Keyword allow users to search the disclosures for specific officials or companies mentionedopensecrets.org. For instance, one could search a company name to see which lawmakers invested in it.
    * Net Worth & Rankings: The site provides analysis of Congress members’ net worth based on the latest available disclosures (currently through 2018). It prominently lists the Richest Members of Congress and Poorest Members of Congress, with their estimated wealth. For example, it shows the top ten richest (e.g. Mark Warner at ~$214 million, Greg Gianforte ~$189 million, etc.)opensecrets.orgopensecrets.org and highlights that these few members account for a large share of Congress’s total wealth. Conversely, it lists the most in debt (“poorest”) members (e.g. Alcee Hastings at –$7.5 million, Emanuel Cleaver –$2.27 million, etc., reflecting liabilities outweighing assets)opensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. Each name is clickable to that member’s detailed personal finance profile.
    * Interactive Data Sections: A menu of subsections is provided (often as numbered tabs or links) for Summary, Net Worth, Assets, Ranked Assets, Most Popular Investments, Partisanship of Assets, Sectors, Industries, Liabilities, Outside Income, and About (which further breaks into “Why This Matters” and “Methodology”)opensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. These sections break down the data in different ways:
        * Net Worth: Overall distribution of wealth, averages, medians, etc. (including timeline charts per year).
        * Assets: Possibly an alphabetical or searchable list of assets held by lawmakers.
        * Ranked Assets: The largest assets held by any lawmaker, ranked by value.
        * Most Popular Investments: Which stocks or investments are most commonly held by members of Congressopensecrets.org.
        * Partisanship of Assets: Analysis of whether certain asset classes are more held by one party vs another.
        * Sectors/Industries: Aggregates the types of investments by economic sector/industry (e.g., how much of Congress’s wealth is in tech stocks, real estate, etc.).
        * Liabilities: A list of the debts (like mortgages, loans) – often highlighting those with significant debts.
        * Outside Income: Income earned by officials outside their Congressional salary (honoraria, business income, etc.).
        * The About section includes a Why this Matters explainer (context on conflicts of interest, etc.)opensecrets.org and a Methodology describing how OpenSecrets collects and estimates the net worth from disclosure formsopensecrets.org. It also features special analyses, like profiles of Freshmen in the 116th Congress or the First Trump Administration from a finances perspectiveopensecrets.org.
    * Data Visualization: Within these pages, OpenSecrets provides visual summaries. For example, bar charts or tables show the percentage growth in wealth for certain members over time. The “Biggest wealth increase in Congress, 2008–2018” table highlights members with the largest percentage increase in net worth over that decade (e.g. Grace Napolitano’s wealth grew over 11,000% from ~$8k to ~$913k)opensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. Similarly, there may be charts showing median wealth of Congress by year, etc. Many tables include an “Export to CSV” optionopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org, allowing users to download the data for offline analysis – a useful feature for researchers.
* Note: The personal finance data currently goes through 2018. A notice on the page explains the scope (data through 2018) and links to methodologyopensecrets.org. This section does not appear to have updated 2019–2020 data integrated yet.
* Other Politician Tools: The Politicians menu also provides a “Look Up a Politician” prompt, guiding users to use the search function to find any state or federal candidate by nameopensecrets.org. This is essentially a shortcut to finding a candidate’s profile via the global search or via the Donor Lookup.
Elections Section
The Elections section covers campaign finance information for different types of races and election-related data:
* Election Overview: An at-a-glance dashboard for a given election cycle. This page (“Election Insights”) provides big-picture statistics such as total money raised/spent in federal races, number of candidates, average costs, etc., for the current or past cyclesopensecrets.org. It’s a starting point for exploring a particular cycle’s data. Users can typically switch the cycle year to see historical overviews (e.g., 2024 vs 2022). It often includes summary graphics like total fundraising by party, and links to deeper data.
* Get Local! Tool: This is a signature interactive tool to “Discover donors in your state”opensecrets.org. The Get Local! page consolidates state-level donation data and geography-based search:
    * It introduces the feature as a way to see “who’s making the big political contributions in your state, and where the money’s coming from (by city, by zip code, with ‘money maps’)”opensecrets.org. It also provides links to the state’s elected officials’ money profiles.
    * The interface includes tabs or section links for State Detail, Zip Code Detail, and Earmarksopensecrets.org:
        * State Detail: Likely allows users to select a state from a dropdown or map and view a state profile. The page contains a dropdown list of states and territoriesopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. When a state is selected, the tool can show aggregate data such as total contributions by or within that state, top contributing cities/zip codes, and the state’s top donors and recipients. It also provides a link to “View the elected officials who represent this state”opensecrets.org, which presumably lists that state’s Governor, Senators, and House members with links to their profiles.
        * Zip Code Detail: Allows entering a specific zip code to find contributions from that areaopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. This reveals which contributors (individuals or organizations) in that locality are active and which candidates or committees they support. It effectively localizes campaign finance data to the neighborhood level.
        * Earmarks: A section likely providing data on congressional earmarks (specific spending provisions) associated with that state or in general. This might include lists of earmarks and which lawmakers sponsored them, tying in financial influence. (This feature is a legacy OpenSecrets tool reflecting the connection between campaign contributions and earmarked spending).
    * The tool has an input for “Enter state or zip”, with a state dropdown and a text field for ZIP entryopensecrets.org. After selection, users click a button (implied “Go” or similar) to retrieve the profile.
    * Output: The state profile shows federal campaign contributions by state and likely breaks down contributions flowing to candidates of that state and from donors in that state. It might include “money maps” – interactive maps highlighting contributions geographically. For example, users might see which cities in the state donate the most, or how contributions to Democrats vs Republicans are distributed regionally. (The current text suggests these features, though full interactive maps may have been on the legacy site.)
    * Help text guides usage: “search for a zip code – or click on a state – then on ‘View the elected officials…’”opensecrets.org, indicating a two-step process to get both donor info and representative info. The Get Local page emphasizes it can show “who’s funding your elected officials” and moreopensecrets.org. This tool heavily relies on state-level data compiled by OpenSecrets and its partners, drawing from state campaign finance databases.
* Presidential Elections: A dedicated section for U.S. presidential campaign finance. It likely offers an overview of funds raised and spent by each presidential candidate in current and past electionsopensecrets.org. Users can choose an election year (e.g. 2024, 2020, 2016) and see the field of candidates with their fundraising totals, spending, top donors, etc. There may be comparisons or candidate rankings by money. It serves as a portal to individual presidential candidate profiles as well.
* Congressional Elections: Similar to the above, but for U.S. Senate and House racesopensecrets.org. It may present summary tables for each Senate race and House race per cycle, highlighting the candidates’ fundraising and outcomes. Often there are lists of the most expensive races, incumbent vs challenger spending differences, and links to detailed pages per race or candidate.
* Ballot Measures: This page provides data on state-level ballot measure campaigns (referenda, initiatives) and the money supporting or opposing themopensecrets.org. Users can explore major ballot measures by state and year, with information on the top donors and amounts spent on each side of an issue. The interface might list the highest-spending ballot measure campaigns nationally, and allow filtering by state or year. Each ballot measure profile shows committees formed to support or oppose it and their fundraising totals.
* Outside Spending: This tool tracks political spending by outside groups (Super PACs, 501(c) nonprofits, party committees in outside capacities, etc.) in electionsopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. The Outside Spending page provides data broken down by cycle and by type of spender:
    * It typically features summary charts “Outside Spending by Cycle, Excluding Party Committees”, and allows the user to view all outside groups vs. subsets like Nonprofit organizations or Super PACsopensecrets.org. These may be toggles or filters at the top of the chart.
    * Data is often presented in a bar chart across election cycles, illustrating the explosion of outside money after 2010. Users might hover or click bars to get exact totals per cycle.
    * Additional tables may list the Top Outside Spending Groups for the current cycle, with amounts and whether they tend to support or oppose Democrats/Republicans. For example, a table might show a group, total spent, and partisan split.
    * The page may also break out categories like Dark Money (spending by groups that don’t disclose donors) vs others. (OpenSecrets historically tracks these categories.)
    * In short, this feature shines a light on independent expenditures and electioneering communications, with user controls to filter by year and type.
* Campaign Expenditures: A searchable database of how campaign committees spend moneyopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. This Expenditures tool allows users to explore spending by candidates and committees – for example, to find out how much a campaign paid to certain vendors or for certain expense categories. The interface likely includes search fields for spender name (committee), vendor name, or purpose. A user might search for a vendor (like a consulting firm) to see all campaigns that paid that firm and how much. This tool provides transparency on the disbursement side of campaign finance. It complements the contributions data by detailing the outflows of campaign funds.
* Political Ads Database: OpenSecrets has a section for Political Ads to track advertising spending:
    * The landing page introduces the topic and offers two branches: Internet Ads and TV & Radio Adsopensecrets.org. These are represented with icons (e.g. a Facebook logo and a television icon) and short descriptions:
        * “Internet Ads – Track political ad spending on Facebook and Google”opensecrets.org.
        * “TV and Radio Ads – Track political ad spending on radio and TV”opensecrets.org.
    * Online Ads Portal: The Online Political Ad Spending page compiles data from Facebook’s Ad Library and Google’s Transparency Report for political adsopensecrets.org. This portal (developed in partnership with academic groups) is essentially a searchable database of advertisers and their online ad spend:
        * At the top, a notice indicates the data coverage (e.g. data goes through January 2021; updates forthcoming)opensecrets.org. Users can switch between a Table view and a Map view via tabsopensecrets.org.
        * Filters/Sliders: There are controls to filter advertisers by total spending range. The page shows “Min Total Spending” and “Max Total Spending” with preset values ($1 up to $1,000,000+)opensecrets.org. These suggest slider inputs or selectable ranges that users can adjust to narrow the list of advertisers (e.g. find only big spenders).
        * Advertiser Table: A tabular list of political advertisers is displayed, sortable by total spending or name. Columns include Advertiser, Facebook Spending, Google Spending, and Total Spendingopensecrets.org. Each advertiser name is a link to a detailed profile of that advertiser’s ad spending. The default sorting may be by Total Spending (highest first). For example, entries show committees like “Trump Make America Great Again Cmte – $94.6M on Facebook, $46.3M on Google, $140.9M total” as the top spender, followed by others like “Biden for President – $130M total,” etc.opensecrets.org. The table also shows non-candidate advertisers (e.g. Facebook itself, which ran issue ads, or the Census Bureau) and issue/interest groups. The bottom of the table has pagination controls (showing number of records and pages)opensecrets.org, since this database contains tens of thousands of records.
        * Users can click an advertiser for more detail. For instance, clicking Trump Make America Great Again Cmte leads to an Advertiser Profile pageopensecrets.org. This profile displays:
            * A search bar to lookup other advertisers (indicating one can quickly navigate to another advertiser from the profile)opensecrets.org.
            * The advertiser’s total spending on Facebook and Google, and combined total, prominently at the topopensecrets.org.
            * Spending by Facebook Page: Many organizations run ads via multiple Facebook pages. The profile lists all Facebook pages associated with the advertiser and how much each page spent. In our example, the Trump committee’s profile lists pages like Donald J. Trump – $60.9M, Team Trump – $15.1M, Mike Pence – $14.1M, etc., totaling the Facebook spendopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. Each page name is linked to the actual Facebook page for referenceopensecrets.org.
            * Spending by Google Advertiser: It shows the entry from Google’s data (Google lumps ads by advertiser name). In the Trump example, it shows one Google advertiser entry “Trump Make America Great Again Committee – $46,290,200” with a link to Google’s transparency siteopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org.
            * Explanatory notes (“About this data”) detail methodology: e.g. Facebook reports are aggregated by the Wesleyan Media Project for the period from Jan 2020 to presentopensecrets.org. It clarifies that spending under $100 is reported as $100 (Facebook’s threshold) and how data from multiple reports are combinedopensecrets.org. The Google data note says it’s exact and starts May 2018opensecrets.org.
            * Platform Spending Over Time: An interactive timeline chart (and corresponding table) shows week-by-week spending on Google and Facebook by that advertiseropensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. In this table, each row is a week’s start date with amounts on Google and Facebook for that week. Users can likely toggle or zoom the chart by date range (the UI suggests draggable handles to adjust timeframeopensecrets.org). This is a valuable visualization to see when spikes in ad spending occurred (often around election dates).
            * These advertiser profiles thus allow deep dives into an online advertiser’s behavior, making the online ads database an important transparency tool. The data source for this portal is explicitly noted: Facebook data comes via reports collected by the Wesleyan Media Project (based on Facebook’s Ad Library API), and Google data from Google’s Political Ad Transparency Reportopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org.
        * The online ads portal covers data from mid-2018 (Google) and 2020 (Facebook) through early 2021 currently, with promises of updates.
    * TV and Radio Ads (FCC Ad Files): The Ad Data page for traditional media ads is integrated as an “Influence & Lobbying” resource on the site (marked as under maintenance currently). It catalogs political advertising purchase filings that broadcasters are required to submit to the FCC. The interface description:
        * A notice at the top indicates the tool is undergoing maintenance and to check backopensecrets.org, implying some features or updates are temporarily disabled.
        * The page is described as “Cataloging FCC Filings”, specifically the broadcasters’ political filedocumentsopensecrets.org. It explains that TV, radio, cable, and satellite stations must upload contracts and paperwork for political ads to the FCC, and OpenSecrets downloads and parses this dailyopensecrets.org.
        * It displays statistics: e.g. “6,217,251 Total Records” in the database, and “0 Records Last 7 Days” (the latter likely due to maintenance mode)opensecrets.org.
        * Search the Filings: There is a search interface allowing users to search for an exact phrase in the ad purchase filingsopensecrets.org. This likely searches the text of PDF documents or the metadata (e.g. advertiser name, candidate name, etc.). Users could enter a candidate’s name or a PAC name to find all ad buys involving them.
        * Recent Filings: A table of the most recent 100 filings is shown with an option to “Download all 100 filings” as a batchopensecrets.org. Each entry includes the Station or cable provider name, and a File Name which is a link to the actual PDF on the FCC’s site (or OpenSecrets mirror), along with the date uploadedopensecrets.org. For example, entries show a station like “WOOD COUNTY TELEPHONE COMPANY” and a file “NAB_Form_Agreement_20200515031051.pdf” uploaded on 05/16/2020opensecrets.org. The file types include agreements, orders, Record of Request forms, etc., which are part of the ad buy documentation.
        * The list appears to group by station, with multiple files (contract, order, request record) for each ad buy, and lists various stations across states (the excerpt shows telecom and TV stations)opensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. It also includes specific political ad references (e.g. file names containing “Trump” or “Collins” in the example)opensecrets.orgopensecrets.org – these indicate buys for ads (Susan Collins’ Senate race appears in multiple files).
        * This tool essentially lets journalists or researchers find who is buying TV/radio ads, where (which station/market), and often how much (though the PDFs need to be read for amounts). It’s an important public file search, integrated into OpenSecrets for user convenience. The data source is the FCC’s online public inspection file databaseopensecrets.org, which OpenSecrets aggregates.
Lobbying & Interest Groups Section
OpenSecrets extensively covers the world of lobbying and interest group influence, with multiple tools and profiles under this section:
* Lobbying Overview: A summary page that introduces lobbying data – highlighting total lobbying spending and key players. It often includes an overview of how much has been spent on federal lobbying in recent years and may feature charts by year. For example, it might note that industries and organizations spend billions each year on lobbying Congress and agenciesopensecrets.org. Key features likely include:
    * A year-by-year graph of total federal lobbying expenditures.
    * The Top Spenders on lobbying in the most recent year (or quarter), e.g. companies or organizations with the largest lobbying budgetsopensecrets.org. A Top Spenders page is listed in the site map (e.g. showing which orgs spent the most, like the OpenSecrets Lobbying database often shows the dollar amounts per org).
    * The Top Lobbying Firms that organizations hire (with their income from lobbying)opensecrets.org.
    * Ranked Sectors: Lobbying spending broken down by economic sector (e.g. Health vs. Finance vs. Communications)opensecrets.org.
    * Issues and Agencies: Data possibly summarized by issue area (e.g. number of clients lobbying on taxes, healthcare, etc.) and by government agency (which agencies are lobbied most).
    * The page likely provides links or tabs to all these breakouts (the site map enumerates Top Spenders, Top Firms, Ranked Sectors, Industries, Contracts, Issues, Agencies, Bills, as well as contributions related to lobbying)opensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. Each of those may be separate interactive pages:
        * Industries: How much each industry collectively spends on lobbying.
        * Bills: A search or list of specific bills and which clients lobbied on them.
        * Contracts: Possibly a listing of lobbying contracts by firms (or specific lobbying transactions reported).
        * Contributions (Influence Explorer): The site map shows Top Contributors and Top Recipients under lobbying contributionsopensecrets.org, possibly referring to a feature correlating campaign contributions with lobbying activities (for example, which lobbyist-connected PACs give the most, etc.).
    * A Search Lobbying function is providedopensecrets.org, allowing users to find specific lobbying records by client name, lobbying firm, issue, or bill numberopensecrets.org. This search tool is very powerful: a user can type a corporation’s name and see all its lobbying disclosure records (who lobbies for them, on what issues, and spending amounts). Or search an issue keyword (like “climate change”) to find all lobbying filings that mention that term, along with the clients.
* Foreign Lobby Watch: A special initiative tracking compliance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). This section shines light on how foreign governments and entities spend money to influence U.S. policy. Features include:
    * Profiles by Country – showing, for example, how much each country’s agents spent or which firms they hired. The site has a “Countries” page listing which countries spend the most on lobbying, influence, tourism, and trade promotion in the U.S.opensecrets.org.
    * Data on individual foreign lobbying contracts: OpenSecrets likely lists firms and individuals registered under FARA, the foreign clients they represent, and the payments involved. Users might search for a country or foreign client to see all associated lobbying activities.
    * This tool uses Department of Justice FARA filings as its data source and presents them in accessible formats. It is accessible via Lobbying & Groups > Foreign Lobby Watch and described as showing foreign governments, companies, and other entities paying agents to influence policyopensecrets.org.
* Revolving Door: A database and profiles documenting the movement of individuals between government positions and lobbying or private sector advocacy roles. Key features:
    * Overview: Explains the phenomenon of the revolving door (e.g. how ex-Congress members or staff leverage their government experience as lobbyists, or vice versa)opensecrets.org.
    * Searchable Profiles: Users can search for a person’s name to see their career history of government and lobbying positionsopensecrets.org. OpenSecrets compiles profiles of officials-turned-lobbyists and lobbyists-turned-officials.
    * Browse by Category: The site map shows subpages for Members (listing members of Congress who became lobbyists, or vice versa), Agencies (listing former employees of specific federal agencies now in lobbying), Congressional Committees (perhaps listing staff directors or others who left for lobbying jobs related to that committee’s scope), Lobbying Firms (listing how many revolving door people are at each firm), and Organizations (listing organizations and how many of their lobbyists have gov’t experience)opensecrets.org. Each of these likely provides lists or statistics. For example, a Lobbying Firms page might rank firms by the number of lobbyists at the firm who are former officials.
    * Each profile (person or organization) includes details and possibly visual timelines of career transitions. The Revolving Door disclaimer (noting limitations of data, etc.) is linked in the site mapopensecrets.org, which suggests context on how the data is gathered.
* PACs (Political Action Committees): The PAC section allows exploration of PAC fundraising and spending:
    * Top PACs: Ranks PACs by total receipts or expenditures in the cycleopensecrets.org. This shows which PACs (corporate, labor, ideological) are the largest. Typically, it might list the committee name and total contributions raised.
    * Industry Breakdown: Perhaps a view of PAC money by industry (e.g. totals given by all PACs in an industry category)opensecrets.org.
    * Leadership PACs: (Note: “Leadership PACs” appear under both Politicians > Congress and PACs categories). There may be a page listing the Leadership PACs of prominent politicians (often used by lawmakers to raise money for colleagues)opensecrets.org. This could include totals and top donors for each leadership PAC.
    * Foreign-connected PACs: A page listing PACs affiliated with foreign-owned or foreign-connected entities (as allowed by law)opensecrets.org.
    * PAC Search: An interface to search for any PAC by name or sponsoropensecrets.org.
    * What is a PAC?: An explanatory page providing background on PACs for users (educational context).
* Organizations (Influence & Lobbying): The Organizations section compiles data on major interest groups, companies, unions, etc., often merging their contributions and lobbying activity:
    * Heavy Hitters List: A signature OpenSecrets feature listing the “top all-time donors” among organizations to U.S. politicsopensecrets.org. This usually covers a long time span (since 1989, for example) and ranks organizations by their total contributions to candidates and parties. The Heavy Hitters list shows, for each organization, the total contributed and the split between Democrats and Republicans (often with percentage tilt). For instance, historically this list includes entities like ActBlue, the NRA, AT&T, etc., with tens of millions donated.
    * Independent Expenditures by Organizations: Possibly a page listing which organizations (through PACs or affiliated groups) are making independent expenditures, and how much.
    * Search Organizations: A search tool to lookup a specific organization profile by nameopensecrets.org.
    * Top Individual Contributors: A feature listing the top individual donors (people, not orgs) and how much they gave, often for the current cycleopensecrets.org. This is distinct from Heavy Hitters (organizations). It identifies mega-donors (like Michael Bloomberg, Sheldon Adelson, etc.) with total amounts and partisan breakdown.
    * Methodology: The Organizations section likely has a methodology page explaining how they compile contributions associated with an organization – for example, by aggregating donations from an organization’s PAC, its employees, and immediate family of employeesopensecrets.org.
* Organization profile pages (accessed via search or by clicking an org name anywhere) present a comprehensive picture of a single interest group’s political spending. For example, an organization profile (for, say, Goldman Sachs or the Teamsters Union) will typically show:
    * Total contributions (to candidates, parties, outside groups) for the cycle, often with an option to view “Career” total across cycles.
    * A breakdown of contributions by party (e.g. what percent to Democrats vs Republicans).
    * Total lobbying expenditures by year for that organization.
    * Top recipients of the organization’s money and top industries or issues it’s associated with.
    * Lists of its lobbyists or revolving door personnel (e.g. highlighting if any of its lobbyists were former officials).
    * These profiles merge data from FEC contributions and lobbying filings to give a full influence profile for the entity.
* 527 Advocacy Groups: This section covers 527 committees, which are political organizations that are not regulated by the FEC in the same way PACs are (often focusing on state-level or issue advocacy). OpenSecrets provides:
    * Introduction: Explanation of what 527 groups are.
    * 527 Committee Listings: e.g. Hotline (possibly a list of new or active 527s), Top 50 Committees by financial activityopensecrets.org.
    * Breakdowns By Industry and By Sector (categorizing 527s by their interest or affiliation)opensecrets.org.
    * Expenditures: Data on what 527s are spending money on.
    * Top Contributors: Who gives to these 527s (since they must disclose donors to the IRS).
    * New Filings: A feed of recently filed reports from 527 groups (since they file periodically to the IRS)opensecrets.org.
    * Search: Ability to search for a specific 527 group by nameopensecrets.org.
    * Other Information: Possibly archives or historical notes.
    * Major Players 2004: Perhaps a legacy page highlighting big 527s in the 2004 cycle (this might be an artifact in the site map, indicating historical data is available).
The Lobbying & Groups section is thus extremely rich, combining real-time data (like quarterly lobbying reports) with historical archives (like the Heavy Hitters and 527 data). All pages in this section include methodology notes where appropriate. For example, a lobbying page might note it uses data from the Senate Office of Public Records, and a 527 page might cite IRS data.
News & Analysis (Learn)
OpenSecrets also functions as a news source and educational resource:
* OpenSecrets News: A newsroom page listing the latest investigative articles and analyses published by OpenSecrets journalistsopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. These articles cover topics such as campaign finance irregularities, lobbying trends, and profiles of political players. The homepage and “Learn” menu highlight recent headlines with category and date (e.g. “Federal judge blocks voter-approved Maine law capping super PAC contributions – Super PACs – July 16, 2025”opensecrets.org). Users can click View all OpenSecrets News to browse or search all articlesopensecrets.org. Articles are organized by topic tags (e.g. Congress, FEC, Super PACs, Cabinet) as seen in the listingsopensecrets.org, enabling filtering by subject. The news articles themselves feature rich content including data visualizations or embeds from the OpenSecrets databases to support their reporting.
* Reports: In-depth analytical reports on money in politics (distinct from shorter news pieces). These might include annual reports, donor profiles, or special research (e.g. gender and money in politics, or lobbying analysis)opensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. They are often PDF or HTML publications compiled by OpenSecrets researchers.
* Issue Profiles: The site provides Issue Profiles which are briefs on specific policy issues (like Gun Rights, Climate, etc.) and how moneyed interests affect themopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. Each profile summarizes the interest groups on each side of the issue and campaign contributions related to that issue.
* Campaign Finance Basics: An educational section explaining the fundamentals of campaign finance laws, terms (PAC, Super PAC, 527, hard vs soft money, etc.)opensecrets.org. It’s aimed at newcomers to the topic.
* Academic Resources: A curated list of resources (datasets, research papers, etc.) for scholars studying political financeopensecrets.org.
* Training Workshops: Information on any training sessions OpenSecrets offers for using money-in-politics dataopensecrets.org.
* Bulk Data: A hub in the Action Center (linked via Learn) where users can download large datasets of OpenSecrets data for researchopensecrets.org. This includes bulk contribution records, lobbying data, etc., updated periodically. The site explicitly invites users to “jump into our bulk data” if they are inspired by OpenSecrets’ dataopensecrets.org.
* APIs: Also in the Action Center, OpenSecrets provides APIs for developers to programmatically access dataopensecrets.org. The API documentation and keys are provided for non-commercial use, allowing integration of real-time data in other applications.
These educational and data-sharing features underscore the front-end’s goal of transparency and empowerment. All pages in the Learn section use a consistent layout for easy reading – clear headings, short paragraphs, and relevant links to data. For instance, an issue profile on “Climate Policy” will contain narrative but also link to the Industry or PAC pages for oil & gas companies, etc., making the experience interactive rather than just static textopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org.
About and Support Sections
The About section is straightforward, focusing on the organization itself. It contains static pages such as:
* Mission – the mission statement of OpenSecretsopensecrets.org.
* Team – lists of staff and board membersopensecrets.org.
* Impact – highlights of OpenSecrets’ influence or recognition.
* Supporters (Funders) – listing major funders or donors to OpenSecretsopensecrets.org.
* Careers and Internships – opportunities to work with OpenSecretsopensecrets.org.
* Partnerships – collaborative projects and partners.
* Press Releases – official announcements from OpenSecretsopensecrets.org.
* Republication – guidelines for republishing OpenSecrets content.
* Get Merch – (external link) where supporters can purchase branded merchandiseopensecrets.org.
* Contact Us – a page with contact information and perhaps a web formopensecrets.org.
* Donate – though the donate links go to a separate donation portal, the site often shows a donation appeal banner (e.g. the “$1 a year” campaign banner on top of pagesopensecrets.org) and a persistent donate button in the headeropensecrets.org. These UI elements encourage support without obstructing content.
The Action Center (part of the site map) also includes:
* Open Data / APIs – as mentioned, resources for obtaining data.
* Buy Custom Data – a service page where one can request custom data sets or analyses from OpenSecrets for a feeopensecrets.org.
* Publications – lists any books or comprehensive reports published (like the “Follow the Money Handbook”).
* Transparency Resources – possibly links to external transparency initiatives or ways to get involved.
UI/UX Features Summary
OpenSecrets’ front-end is designed for both casual users and power researchers, with a mix of intuitive navigation and advanced data tools:
* Navigation & Menus: The hierarchical menus (with headings like Federal, State, Campaigns, Spending, etc., under each main category) logically group contentopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. This allows drill-down: e.g. Elections > Spending > Political Ads leads you to the advertising databases easily.
* Filtering and Forms: Virtually every data listing offers filters. Examples include filtering members of Congress by party/chamberopensecrets.org, filtering online ad buyers by spending rangeopensecrets.org, selecting cycles or years on profilesopensecrets.org, or using multi-criteria forms in Donor Lookup (name, state, employer, etc.)opensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. These filters are presented as dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, or text inputs, and are clearly labeled.
* Autocomplete & Suggestions: The global search suggestions (top donor/employer/recipient searches) is a key autocomplete feature guiding users to popular data pointsopensecrets.org. Additionally, fields like the state selector or employer field in donor lookup may provide suggestions or at least dropdown lists for consistency (to avoid misspellings).
* Interactive Charts/Graphs: Many pages incorporate interactive visualizations. For example, the campaign profile pages have interactive charts for contributions breakdownopensecrets.org. The online ads timeline chart is interactive with zoomingopensecrets.org. The lobbying overview likely has hover-over charts. The site uses the Fabric.js library on the front-endopensecrets.org, which may be for rendering custom charts or graphics. Graphical elements like maps (for Get Local) and pie charts (for source of funds) engage users and are usually accompanied by underlying data tables for precision.
* Data Tables: Tabular data is formatted for readability with clear headers and the ability to sort or page through entries. For example, the donor lookup results (when displayed) or the outside spending groups list are sortable. Large tables often have CSV export optionsopensecrets.org as noted, enhancing utility for analysis.
* State/Industry Pages Integration: Although still being integrated, the site acknowledges when data is from a “legacy” source, using banners or notes (e.g. the note about state-level data being on a legacy site)opensecrets.org. Links are provided so users can still access that information, preserving comprehensiveness.
* Breadcrumbs & Section Labels: Pages are titled with clear headers (often an h1 for the page title and h2 or h3 for section titles) making it clear what data you are viewing. Share buttons (Twitter, Facebook) accompany these titles for easy sharing of specific profiles or pagesopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org.
* Embedded Visualizations: When images are used (such as legislator photos or graphs), they are embedded inline with captions or labels. For instance, leader profiles on the Congress page show thumbnail photos of the politicians next to their namesopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. Issue profile pages might embed charts or illustrations at the top.
Throughout the site, performance considerations are evident: the donor lookup warns that broad queries will take longer due to millions of recordsopensecrets.org. The UI encourages refinement of queries to optimize load times. When queries are complex, the site might queue results (sometimes a spinner or waiting message is displayed, though not visible in static excerpts).
External Data Sources and Integrations
OpenSecrets’ front-end is a window into several underlying public data sources, which it aggregates and standardizes. Key data sources and where they appear on the site include:
* Federal Election Commission (FEC) Data: This is the backbone for campaign contributions to federal candidates and committees, as well as PAC finances and independent expenditures. All donation figures on candidate profiles, donor lookup, and PAC/party pages are drawn from FEC filings. The site explicitly notes that numbers on profiles are based on FEC data releases (e.g. “figures in federal profiles are taken from databases uploaded by the FEC… updated after the first of every month”)opensecrets.orgopensecrets.org. Contribution records in Donor Lookup include all individuals contributing $200 or more (the FEC’s itemization threshold)opensecrets.org. Independent expenditure totals and outside spending pages use FEC-reported data as well (with OpenSecrets classifications to separate Super PACs vs others). Personal financial disclosure summary figures (though collected from Congress, not FEC) are processed by OpenSecrets but campaign finance parts like candidate self-financing or othercontributions are from FEC categoriesopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org.
* State Campaign Finance Data: For state races and officials (governors, state legislators, etc.), data is sourced from state campaign finance agencies and historically provided via the National Institute on Money in Politics (FollowTheMoney). OpenSecrets merged with that organization, so legacy state data is accessible via links (e.g., a prompt to visit FollowTheMoney.org for state-level datasetsopensecrets.org). The Get Local tool and state profiles are built on these datasets, aggregating contributions to state candidates and committees from state disclosure reports.
* IRS Data for 527s: Section 527 political organizations (like governors’ associations, some issue groups, etc.) file periodic reports with the IRS. The OpenSecrets 527 section uses these IRS filings to list contributions to and expenditures by 527 committees. New filing alerts and the totals for these groups are extracted from IRS Form 8872 reports.
* Senate Office of Public Records (SOPR) Lobbying Disclosures: All federal lobbying expenditures and client information come from lobbying disclosure reports filed quarterly with the Senate (and House). OpenSecrets takes this raw data (client, amount, issues, lobbyists) and populates the Lobbying section. For example, totals on “Top Spenders” or “Lobbying Overview” are sums of all lobbying reports for a year, as released by SOPR. The site often updates lobbying data shortly after each quarterly filing deadline.
* FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) Data: The Foreign Lobby Watch relies on the Department of Justice’s FARA database of registered foreign agents and their disclosed activities (including political contributions by foreign agents, meetings, and payments from foreign principals). OpenSecrets processes these semi-annual filings to present totals by country and client. This data source is unique and separate from FEC/SOPR.
* Congressional Personal Financial Disclosures: The personal finance section is built on the annual disclosure forms that members of Congress (and some other officials) file, which are public records. OpenSecrets compiles these (often PDF) filings and estimates assets, liabilities, and calculates net worth ranges. They also incorporate stock transaction reports (for sections like “violation of STOCK Act” news) as needed. These forms come from the Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate. Because disclosures are not digital, OpenSecrets employs research to enter and verify these data.
* FCC Political Ad Files: The TV & radio ad purchase data comes straight from the FCC’s public file system. OpenSecrets automates retrieval of these PDFs and parses some metadata (station, dates, advertiser) to allow searchingopensecrets.org. The raw documents (e.g. NAB Agreement forms, purchase orders) are from broadcasters complying with federal law.
* Social Media and Tech Platforms: The online ads data is directly from Facebook Ad Library reports and Google’s Transparency Reports, aggregated through an academic partnership. The site credits the Wesleyan Media Project for the Facebook data collectionopensecrets.org, highlighting a collaboration where outside experts feed data into OpenSecrets’ front-end. Google’s data is fetched from Google’s API and covers ad spend by advertiser.
* Internal CRP Research: Some unique datasets, like Revolving Door profiles, “Elite donor” (top individual contributors) lists, and historical “heavy hitter” rankings, are compiled by OpenSecrets (formerly the Center for Responsive Politics) through years of research. They are not directly from a government source but derived from multiple sources (FEC data combined with employer info, etc.). For example, the Heavy Hitters (top all-time donors since 1989) is aggregated from FEC records over decades, with CRP assigning donations to parent organizationsopensecrets.org. The Revolving Door data comes from lobbyist registrations, staff directories, and self-reported employment histories, curated by OpenSecrets analysts.
* Additional Sources: The site sometimes integrates data from other agencies for specific content. For instance, Personal finances include federal officials beyond Congress (like Cabinet members) using disclosure forms from the Office of Government Ethics. COVID or other special spending trackers (if any on the site) might use government expenditure databases.
OpenSecrets clearly documents data provenance on relevant pages. Profile pages include notes on data currency (e.g. “based on data released on 07/30/25” for contributions)opensecrets.org and explain any lags or limitationsopensecrets.org. The donor lookup page explicitly reminds users that it doesn’t provide street addresses and warns against misuse of data in line with FEC legal restrictionsopensecrets.org. Methodology pages give further detail on how data is processed and categorized (such as how contributions are categorized by industry using donor employer informationopensecrets.orgopensecrets.org).
In summary, OpenSecrets.org’s front-end delivers a full-featured, public-facing experience for exploring political money. Every publicly accessible page – from high-level summaries to granular search results – is accounted for with interactive elements, explanatory context, and links back to raw data. The site’s design balances clarity for casual users (with summaries, highlights, and learning resources) and depth for advanced users (with filters, downloads, and comprehensive databases). By preserving intuitive navigation (top menus, breadcrumbs) and offering robust tools (search forms, autofill suggestions, charts, maps, and tables with sorting/export), OpenSecrets enables replication of the experience where a user can seamlessly navigate from a broad question (“Who are the biggest donors?”) to specific answers supported by data (“This specific PAC contributed $5 million, composed of these donors, and here are the FEC recordsopensecrets.org”). All content is connected by a unifying design and underpinned by reliable data sources, making the OpenSecrets front-end a model for transparent, interactive information delivery in the civic tech space.
