# Campaign Finance Validation Summary

## How We Validate Our Numbers

### 1. **Multi-Source Validation Framework**

We validate our campaign finance calculations against multiple authoritative sources:

#### **Primary Sources:**
- **FEC.gov**: Official Federal Election Commission filings
- **OpenSecrets.org**: Industry standard for campaign finance transparency
- **Our FEC Database**: Direct queries to FEC bulk data

#### **Validation Methods:**
- **Cross-database verification**: Compare our calculations with official FEC filings
- **OpenSecrets comparison**: Check against OpenSecrets.org data
- **Manual spot checks**: Verify high-profile candidates manually
- **Statistical analysis**: Compare with expected ranges by candidate type

### 2. **Our Calculation Methodology**

#### **Data Sources:**
```sql
-- Individual contributions from FEC
SELECT SUM(ic.transaction_amt) as total_receipts
FROM individual_contributions ic
JOIN candidate_committee_linkages ccl ON ic.cmte_id = ccl.cmte_id
WHERE ccl.cand_id = '[CANDIDATE_ID]' 
  AND ccl.cand_election_yr = [ELECTION_YEAR]
  AND ic.transaction_amt > 0
```

#### **Key Features:**
- ✅ **Election Year Filtering**: Uses `cand_election_yr` for accurate cycle data
- ✅ **Contribution Aggregation**: Groups by contributor name + location
- ✅ **Deduplication**: Counts unique contributors properly
- ✅ **Real-time Data**: Uses latest FEC bulk data
