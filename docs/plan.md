## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
- **fec_complete**: Read-only FEC data (candidates, committees, contributions, expenditures)
- **goodvote**: Application database with views and person-based mapping
- **Views**: fec_contributions, fec_committees, fec_candidates, etc.

### Key Components
- **Layout**: Header, Footer, Navigation
- **Pages**: Politicians, Elections, Lobbying, Search, About
- **Components**: Data tables, charts, filters, search forms
- **Utilities**: Database connections, data fetching, API routes

### Data Flow
1. FEC data → PostgreSQL (fec_complete)
2. Views created in goodvote database
3. Next.js API routes fetch data
4. React components display data with filtering/sorting

## Current Status: Phase 5 - Elections Section
Completed project setup, database integration, core navigation, comprehensive FEC data integration, key elections features, and comprehensive testing framework. All 9 FEC tables are now accessible through the platform with full test coverage. Currently working on congressional elections tracking and outside spending analysis.

## Next Steps
1. Add congressional elections tracking
2. Build outside spending analysis
3. Create politician profile pages with comprehensive FEC data
4. Implement lobbying overview page
5. Add organization profiles and revolving door database
6. Run comprehensive test suite to validate all functionality
