# Real Congressional District Boundaries

## ✅ **SUCCESS: Real District Boundaries Implemented**

The congressional district map now displays **REAL** congressional district boundaries from the US Census Bureau, copied from the successful goodvote2 implementation.

### 🎯 **What We Accomplished:**

1. **Found the Previous Implementation**: Located the `goodvote2` project with real congressional district boundaries
2. **Copied Real Boundaries**: Successfully copied 439 real district boundaries from Census Bureau data
3. **Integrated with Current System**: Combined the real boundaries with our humanity score data
4. **Verified Functionality**: Confirmed the map is working with real district boundaries

### 📊 **Current Implementation:**

- **Total Districts**: 439 real congressional districts
- **Data Source**: US Census Bureau TIGER/Line 2022 (from goodvote2)
- **Boundary Type**: Real geographic boundaries (not rectangles!)
- **States Covered**: All 50 states + DC
- **Data Integration**: Real boundaries + simulated humanity scores and funding data
