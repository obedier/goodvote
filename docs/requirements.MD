Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs update your requirements document into a detailed, implementation-ready spec for a fully functional Israel Lobby Influence Dashboard built on top of your local PostgreSQL instance with FEC data (2020‚Äì2026). I‚Äôll incorporate everything we‚Äôve learned so far ‚Äî candidate ID handling, Bioguide mapping, scoring models, PAC list, and frontend experience.
 
üìã Requirements Document
Project: Israel Lobby Influence Dashboard
Primary Objective: Provide US voters, journalists, and researchers with transparent, district-by-district visibility into the influence of the Israel Lobby (e.g., AIPAC and affiliated PACs) on federal elections and incumbents, starting with the 119th Congress and extending to candidates for 2026.
 
üéØ Core Objective
Empower voters concerned with Palestinian human rights to:
1.	Identify pro-Israel vs. pro-Palestine candidates at all federal levels.
2.	Understand how much Israel-aligned money is involved in their elections.
3.	Track endorsements, voting records, and lobby expenditures.
4.	Provide actionable tools to volunteer, donate, and share content for aligned candidates.
 
‚úÖ Primary User Requirements

‚Ä¢	Tables to extract:
o	cand.txt / candidate_master ‚Üí Candidate names, IDs, office, district.
o	pas2 / committee contributions ‚Üí PAC-to-candidate contributions.
o	independentexpenditure.csv ‚Üí SuperPAC spending (support/oppose).
o	committee_master ‚Üí Identify AIPAC & affiliates by FEC IDs.
PACs to Include
‚Ä¢	AIPAC PAC (C00797670)
‚Ä¢	United Democracy Project (UDP) (C00799031)
‚Ä¢	NORPAC (C00247403)

2. Congressional Voting Records
‚Ä¢	Use Congress.gov Roll Call API for pro-Israel votes:
o	Military aid bills (Iron Dome, etc.).
o	Anti-BDS resolutions.
o	Aid-to-Israel appropriation bills.
‚Ä¢	Score 25% of influence rating from votes.
________________________________________
3. Cook PVI
‚Ä¢	Import Cook Political Report PVI scores (CSV or subscription dataset).
‚Ä¢	Used for Party Lean visualization.
________________________________________
4. Bioguide ID Integration
‚Ä¢	For incumbents: Link multiple FEC cand_ids to a single bioguide_id.
‚Ä¢	For challengers/non-elected: Create deterministic person_id using normalized name + state + year.
‚Ä¢	Ensures continuity when candidates run for multiple offices.
________________________________________
üßÆ Scoring Model
Metric	Source	Weight	Rule
Lobby Contributions	FEC PAC + SuperPAC	75%	Any $$ = Pro-Israel Supported (red flag)
Endorsements	PAC websites	20%	AIPAC/DMFI/Pro-Israel America endorsement
Voting Record	Congress.gov	25%	Yea on pro-Israel bills
Party Lean	Cook PVI	Contextual	Not scored, but shown in alternate view
Threshold:
‚Ä¢	Red: Lobby-backed OR endorsed.
‚Ä¢	Green: Signed no-lobby pledge OR proven pro-Palestine stance.
‚Ä¢	Gray: Insufficient data.
